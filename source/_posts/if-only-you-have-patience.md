I was thinking these days——what will make it possible that those who visit my website be willing to leave some message on the passage.Apperantly,it seems(and maybe it is true) that there is no other person except me viewing the page.It's not a terrible thing,because my oringinal purpose to build this website is to find a place that no one konws me.However,when it comes to expressing the feeling,you would never be excluded from seeking an audience.

I used to think that it looks very stupid for a Chinese to expressing his feelings in English,now I have got the point——by using a hard-interpret style,you will finally find an real audience.

It's June 30th now,what I have done since June 21st,when all my exams end? I have set up a J2EE develop environment in my computer and  make a helloworld,which can response a request from Android OS——this will make it possible for our Self-made Android Game Updating.

As for our Game,I am so sorry for the delay of Alpha version,my project partner and I are considering using a new display form(OpenGL ES),which means our Game Engine is not ready(or perfect enough) for completing a game(although it seems OK for others).And,since I have to prepare my Entrance Examination of Postgraduate,it may be at least half a year before I can get back to work.

   ** OK,it's sharing time again.**
This is a Independent Game made by a couple,for almost two years I have been looking forward to it,and according to the author'blog,the beta release is around the corner.

Look like Minecraft,and more ARPG style!

This game will support multiplay(that's why I strongly recommend it)

Finally,a song as usual.
